<b>  About Us </b>
<br>

We are three students from Loreto College in Cavan.
We started watching vines when the app became popular. But unfortunately the app was
deleted from the app store at the beginning of 2017.
After a few months many vine compilations were created and uploaded to YouTube.
Because we missed watching vines so much we started watching them again through the compilations.
<br>
<br>
Througout this week of coding with the vodafone
#CodeItLikeAGirl team, we have learnt many new skills. We have really enjoyed
the course and working as a team to create this webpage.
 At the beginning of the week, we had little knowledge about coding, but now we
can create a website with minimum help.
