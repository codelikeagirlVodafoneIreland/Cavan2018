  <div id=ulster1>

    <p> Dun a Ri Forest Park forms part of what was formerly the Cabra Estate which was owned by the Pratt family. <br>
      The lands were acquired by the Irish Forest Service in 1959 and were developed into a forest park in the early 1970s..
      There is a great diversity of wildlife in the park. The flora is varied and in many areas spectacular. The tree storey is dominated by oak and ash but includes many other species often with an under storey of hazel, holly and rhododendron. <br>
      Walking is a great way to experience the delights of Dun a Ri while also benefiting both physical and mental health. Set your pace to suit your enjoyment and you will quickly feel fitter and better.

  <h2> The Giant's Causeway </h2>
    <img src="ulster-pictures/giants.jpg" alt="Giants Causeway" width="40%">

  <div id=ulster2>

    <p>Formed 50 to 60 million years ago, during the Paleogene Period, the Giant's Causeway resulted from successive flows of lava inching toward the coast and cooling when they contacted the sea. <br>
    The star of the show is Fionn mac Cumhaill (Finn McCool) – an Irish giant who picked a fight with Scottish big man Benandonner.
    Legend has it that the giants loathed each other. And so one day after enduring insults from Benandonner, Fionn built a path to use as stepping-stones to reach Scotland, which was then ripped up by Benandonner. <br>
    The result was the Giant’s Causeway.

    <p>Titanic Belfast is a visitor attraction opened in 2012, a monument to Belfast's shipyard in the city where the RMS Titanic was built.
      The Titanic Belfast visitor attraction extends over nine galleries, with multiple dimensions to the exhibition.
      The journey goes beyond the aftermath of the sinking, to the discovery of the wreck and continues into the present day in the Ocean Exploration Centre.

  <div id=ulster4>

     <p>Nine miles off the coast of County Donegal, you’ll find one of the most remote islands- Tory Island.
       The island is steeped in history, mythology and folklore, and today is home to a community of artists inspired by its wild and rugged beauty.
       What’s more, in a nod back to ancient times, this Irish-speaking community of just over 130 people is led by a king; a fellow islander elected by the people.

       <h2>    <p> Marble Arch Caves </p> </h2>
     <img src="ulster-pictures/marblearch.jpg" alt="marble arch" width="40%">

     <p> Visitors to the Marble Arch Caves can experience a fascinating natural underworld of rivers, waterfalls, winding passages and lofty chambers while stunningly beautiful cave formations glisten all around.
       The tour consists of a short walk down through the Marble Arch National Nature Reserve; a relaxing 10 minute underground boat journey; and a pleasant stroll of approximately 1.5km through the showcave.
        There are a few sets of steps within the showcave system and 150 steps to exit the cave.
