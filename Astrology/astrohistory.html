<h5><p>The Babylonians are generally credited with the birth of astrology.
Their astrological charts enabled them to predict the recurrence of seasons and certain celestial events.
So in the beginning and for more than 2,000 years, astrology and astronomy were the same science.</p></h5>
<br>
<h5><p>Babylonian astrology was introduced to the Greeks early in the 4th century B.C. and, through the studies of Plato, Aristotle,
and others, astrology came to be highly regarded as a science. It was soon embraced by the Romans
 (the Roman names for the zodiacal signs are still used today) and the Arabs and later spread throughout the entire world.</p></h5>
<br>
<h5><p>While earliest astrology was used to bring a sense of order out of apparent chaos,
 it was soon utilized to predict weather patterns, primarily for agricultural purposes.
  It was eventually broadened to include forecasts of natural disasters and war and other events in the course of human affairs.
  Amassing successes in these fields, it was a natural progression for astrology to be used as
 counsel for kings and emperors and, in time, for all of us.</p></h5>
