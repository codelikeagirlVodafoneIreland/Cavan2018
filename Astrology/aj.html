Clever and curious Gemini is a sign that thinks fast, communicates well, and is full of ideas. Their versatility and adaptability stem from their split personality -- part intellect, part scatterbrained! The Twins are powered by information, and feel most at home when sharing thoughts and conversations with others</p>
