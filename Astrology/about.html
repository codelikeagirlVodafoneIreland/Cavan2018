We are three Transition Year students from Loreto College Cavan. We designed this website as we have a very keen interest in Astrology and Horoscopes. Talking about myself, I am a Taurus. And when I check some of my star sign descriptions they are mostly accurate. One of my teammates is a Taurus as well. My other teammate is a Cancer. The description for Cancer perfectly describes her. We thought this was cool and very interesting. This is what inspired us to come as a team and create this website, AstroDaily.
