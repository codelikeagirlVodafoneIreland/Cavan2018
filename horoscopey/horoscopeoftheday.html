<h1> Taurus: </h1>
<h3><br>The great period of meditation that started for you a few weeks ago is now finished, Taurus.<br>
<br>This means that you are going to have to get back into the real world again! You are going to <br>
<br>have to test out how the "new and improved" you operates in everyday life. Get ready. You can<br>
<br>expect some real changes!<br><h3>

<h2> Aries: </h2>
<h3><br>Try not to get weighed down by emotions today, but give them the opportunity to have their time in the<br>
<br>spotlight. You may find that there is a strong force working to cover up the truth of what you really feel.<br>
<br>Make sure you express yourself openly and honestly. At the same time, you don't want be so overly dramatic<br>
<br>that you blow things out of proportion.<br><h3>

<h2> Pisces: </h2>
<h3><br>Your head is filled with passion today, and you may be feeling a bit more sentimental than usual.<br>
<br>The one difficulty with this is that there may not be an appropriate situation in which to express this<br>
<br>emotion as fully as you might like. Try to navigate the waters toward a safe place where the people<br>
<br>around you support you. Avoid those who might want to pop your bubble.<br><h3>

<h3><br> Be persistent and don't give up the fight today, It might seem as if you aren't making progress<br>
<br>and that it's harder to make decisions about anything. You'll find that other people are just as confused <br>
<br>as you. Find a clever way to express what you feel. You can sort the issues out with the help of others as<br>
<br>long as you're in touch with your inner state.
<br><h3>

<h2> Capricorn: </h2>
<h3><br> Today is a good day to dream. Be aware that structured forces may try to convince you that<br>
<br>the route you want to take isn't the most practical. You don't necessarily have to be practical in<br>
<br>order to be successful or prosperous. Use your imagination. Let your creative spirit lead you to the<br>
<br>next step. Find true strength in your ability to recognize and understand the needs of others.<br><h3>

<h2> Cancer: </h2>
<h3><br>You'll find that you have a much better than usual connection with the people around you.<br>
<br>Your psychic sense is acute, and you should use this sixth sense to pick up things that other people<br>
<br>might miss. Don't let the busy chatter of the day disrupt your connection with deeper thoughts and idea.<br>
<br>People are more malleable today than usual.<br><h3>

<h2> Aquarius: </h2>
<h3><br>You might feel like your emotions are up in the air. As soon as you feel emotional,<br>
<br>there may be a more structured force telling you to be reasonable. Both camps are valid,<br>
<br>so try not to let one overpower the other. Don't completely disregard your emotions in favor<br>
<br>of a more cerebral way of handling a situation. And don't let your emotions take control of your <br>
<br>actions either. Balance is the watchword today.<br><h3>

<h2> Sagittarius: </h2>
<h3><br>You may feel rather lazy and out of touch today. It could be that your emotions have taken a<br>
<br>stronger hold on your psyche than your rational way of thinking. Therefore, making decisions might<br>
<br>be quite difficult. In matters of the heart, you could feel a bit more romantic than usual.<br>
<br>There is a great sentimental mood to the day that's causing you to empathize with others.<br><h3>

<h2> Virgo: </h2>
<h3><br>Your current plan of attack may run into some snags today. This might be caused by an emotional<br>
<br>need that you may not have recognized earlier. The problem is that your head may say one thing while<br>
<br>your gut tells you something else. You might need to put everything on hold while you sort out this inner<br>
<br>turmoil. There's a great deal of compassion in the air.<br><h3>

<h2> Gemini: </h2>
<h3><br>You might need to hold your tongue today. People's feelings are more easily hurt now,<br>
<br>and the slightest criticism could be misinterpreted as a terrible insult. When in doubt,<br>
<br>keep your mouth shut. Turn your attention inward and focus on your emotions. Try to keep your<br>
<br>mental chatter to a minimum and concentrate more on how you feel rather than on what you think.<br><h3>

<h2> Scorpio: </h2>
<h3><br>This is an excellent day for you. You should find that things are running smoothly and to<br>
<br>your advantage. Watch out for those who may want to rain on your parade by bombarding you with<br>
<br>information that doesn't really connect with the way you feel. This information is unrelated to<br>
<br>the real issues - how you feel and why. Pay attention to your heart.<br><h3>

<h2> Libra: </h2>
<h3><br>You may need to take a more disciplined approach to your communication today.<br>
<br>Try not to be so harsh and limiting with your words. People respond better to comforting<br>
<br>expressions and a sympathetic tone. Cold, abrasive facts will only aggravate an existing wound.<br>
<br>Tone things down. Allot yourself some quiet time to be alone and contemplate your state of mind.<br><h3>
