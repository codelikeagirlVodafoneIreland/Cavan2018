<h1>The Zodiac</h1>
<h3>The zodiac (which is derived from the Greek word meaning "circle of animals") is believed to have developed in ancient Egypt and later adopted by the Babylonians.
<br>
Early astrologers knew it took 12 lunar cycles (i.e., months) for the sun to return to its original position.
<br>
They then identified 12 constellations that they observed were linked to the progression of the seasons and assigned them names of certain animals and persons
<br>
(in Babylonia, for example, the rainy season was found to occur when the Sun was in a particular constellation which was then named Aquarius, or water bearer).
<br>
<br>
The signs of the zodiac are subdivided into four groups:
<br>
Fire Signs: Aries, Sagittarius, Leo
<br>
Water Signs: Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces
<br>
Air Signs: Libra, Aquarius, Gemini
<br>
Earth Signs: Capricorn, Taurus, Virgo
<br>
Each of these four groups is inscribed in its own quadrant, or group of "houses," on a circle.
<br>
The division of the 12 houses is based on Earth's daily rotation and relates to such circumstances as relationships, finances, travel, etc.
<br>
The division of the 12 signs of the zodiac, on the other hand, is based on the earth's year-long rotation around the Sun and relates to character traits and areas of life
<br>
(e.g., Venus represents affection, Mercury represents speech and writing, etc.). Each planet is associated with two signs, and the Sun and Moon with one each.
<br>
<br>
Approximately 2000 B.C., Babylonian astrologers believed that the Sun, Moon, and the five planets known at that time (Jupiter, Mars, Mercury, Saturn, and Venus)
<br>
possessed distinct powers. Mars, for example, appeared to be red and was associated with aggression and war.</h3>
